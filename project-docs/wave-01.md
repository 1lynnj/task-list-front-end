# Wave 01: Rending `Task` and `TaskList`

In this wave, fulfill the following requirements:

## `App`
The `App` component holds the list of task objects in `TASKS`. 

The `App` component should render the `TaskList`


## `TaskList`
The `TaskList` component should render the `Task` components for each of the task objects in the `TASKS` list in `App`.

## `Task`
The `Task` component should display the task title and the status of the task (complete or incomplete).
    - The functionality of marking a task complete/incomplete will be handled in Wave 02.

The `Task` should also hold as `id`. The `id` does not need to be rendered, but it will be used when handling events.

## Hints
Use PropTypes to help determine the required props for each component. In particular, check `Task`.
